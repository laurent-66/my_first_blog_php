Welcome to my first PHP object blog

For the installation you have to clone the master branch from my repository and copy it either by downloading the Zip file or run the git clone command followed by the link proposed by github on your local PC.

You will find an sql file at the root of the project. It should be installed on your local server.

Once done, you will need to connect the project to the database and identify yourself to be able to receive the emails sent from the contact form of the site.

For the mail identifiers you must complete the file located in config/ mail/mail_config.php.dist

For the connection identifiers to the database you must complete the file located in src/ Repository/AbstractRepository.php.dist
